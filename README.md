# 2Jot

**Jot it. Pin it. Done.**

A note app that installs **two icons** on your phone.

Website: [2jot.app](https://2jot.app)

## Problem

You jot down notes all day - ideas, tasks, lists. But when you need THE important one, you scroll through everything. Too many taps. Too much friction.

## Solution

**2Jot** (= "to jot") - your note stream. Write quick notes like a chat with yourself.

**2Pin** (= "to pin") - instant access to ONE pinned note. No scrolling, no searching.

All notes stay **only on your phone**. No account. No cloud. No sync.

## How it works

1. Open **2Jot**, write notes
